# airquality

The goal of airquality is to reduce the burden of gathering,
standardizing, and analyzing air quality data. This package is very much
a work in progress, significant changes will occur and there is no
gaurentee things will work as expected.

## Installation

You can install the development version of airquality from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("B-Nilson/airquality")
```

## Utilities

A few useful functions for working with air quality data.

``` r
library(airquality)

# Convert between units
convert_units(c(-20, 0, 20), in_unit = "degC", out_unit = "degF")
convert_units(c(0, 50, 100), in_unit = "ppm", out_unit = "ppb", keep_units = FALSE)
```

## Data Collection

### Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) Data

Here’s how you can get regulatory FEM airquality data. This data is
considered the “gold standard” for realtime observations. Due to upfront
and maintenance costs these stations tend to be prioritized for areas
with more people.

``` r
library(airquality)

# All FEM data sources for (a) location(s)
get_station_data("Prince George, BC, Canada",
  date_range = c("2023-01-01 00", "2023-01-03 23"),
  networks = "FEM")

# AirNow (US + Partner Agencies) only for (a) specific station(s)
stations = get_airnow_stations()
get_airnow_data(stations$site_id[1],
  date_range = c("2023-01-01 00", "2023-01-03 23"))

# BC Gov. (Canada) only for (a) specific station(s)
stations = get_bcgov_stations()
get_bcgov_data(stations$site_id[1],
  date_range = c("2023-01-01 00", "2023-01-03 23"))

# AB Gov. (Canada) only for (a) specific station(s) 
stations = get_abgov_stations()
get_abgov_data(stations$site_id[1],
  date_range = c("2023-01-01 00", "2023-01-03 23"))
```

### Low-cost Monitor (LCM) Data

Here’s how you can get LCM airquality data. These monitors are not as
accurate as their FEM counterparts, but due to their significantly lower
cost they can be installed in more locations. Caution is recommended to
ensure unrealistic observations are properly flagged and removed before
analysis.

``` r
library(airquality)

# All LCM networks for (a) location(s)
get_station_data(
  "Prince George, BC, Canada",
  date_range = c("2023-01-01 00", "2023-01-03 23"),
  networks = "LCM")

# PurpleAir (Global) [under development]
read_key = "YOUR-API-KEY" # see develop.purpleair.com
stations = get_purpleair_stations("Prince George, BC, Canada", api_key = read_key)
get_purpleair_data(
  stations$site_id[1],
  date_range = c("2023-01-01 00", "2023-01-03 23"),
  api_key = read_key)

# AQEgg (Global?) [to come]

# Clarity (Global?) [to come]
```

## Air Quality Standards \[under development\]

Air quality managers and organizations set standards that are used to
assess air quality impacts in their region. Here are ways you can
calculate these standards with observation data:

``` r
library(airquality)

# Canadian AQHI
AQHI(pm25 = 25, o3 = 70, no2 = 20)
AQHI_plus(pm25 = 25)

# Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards 
CAAQS(...)

# United States AQI
AQI(pm25 = 20, o3 = 70, no2 = 20)
AQI(pm25 = 25)
```

## Analysis Plots \[under development\]

Here are ways you can make useful analysis plots built using ggplot2:

``` r
library(airquality)

# Taylor Diagrams
taylor_diagram(...)

# Wind Roses
wind_rose(...)
```

# Package index
