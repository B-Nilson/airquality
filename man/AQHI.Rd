\title{Calculate Canadian AQHI from hourly PM2.5, NO2, and O3 observations}
\usage{
AQHI(datetimes, pm25_hourly, no2_hourly = NA, o3_hourly = NA, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{datetimes}{Vector of hourly datetime values corresponding to observations. Date gaps will be filled automatically.}

\item{pm25_hourly}{Vector of hourly mean fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations (ug/m^3).}

\item{no2_hourly}{(Optional). Vector of hourly mean nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations (ppb). If not provided AQHI+ will be calculated from PM2.5 only.}

\item{o3_hourly}{(Optional). Vector of hourly mean ozone (O3) concentrations (ppb). If not provided AQHI+ will be calculated from PM2.5 only.}

\item{quiet}{(Optional). Logical (TRUE/FALSE) value indicating if warnings/messages should be printed. Default is FALSE}
}
\value{
A tibble (data.frame) with columns (*if all 3 pollutants provided):
date, pm25, o3*, no2*, pm25_rolling_3hr*, o3_rolling_3hr*, o3_rolling_3hr*,
 AQHI, AQHI_plus, risk, high_risk_pop_message, general_pop_message, AQHI_plus_exceeds_AQHI*
 and potentially more rows than `length(datetimes)` (due to any missing hours being filled with NA values).
}
\description{
The Canadian Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) combines the health risk of
fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a scale from 1-10 (+).
The AQHI is "the sum of excess mortality risk associated with individual pollutants
from a time-series analysis of air pollution and mortality in Canadian cities,
adjusted to a 0â€“10 scale, and calculated hourly on the basis of trailing 3-hr average pollutant concentrations."

The Canadian AQHI+ is a modification of the Canadian Air Quality Health Index (AQHI).
AQHI+ only uses fine particulate matter (PM2.5) instead of the combination of PM2.5, ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
, and is calculated using hourly means instead of using 3 hour means.
The AQHI+ overrides the AQHI if it exceeds the AQHI, which typically occurs during wildfire smoke events.

The AQHI was originally published by Steib et. al in 2008 (\link{https://doi.org/10.3155/1047-3289.58.3.435}),
 and has been adopted by all Canadian provinces/territories (except Quebec where they use the AQI instead of the AQHI/AQHI+).
